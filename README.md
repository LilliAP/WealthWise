The WealthWise Financial Advising system contains 5 main components:
  1. User Management
  2. Advisor Scheduling
  3. Financial Tools
  4. Learning Hub
  5. Financial News

The system supports 2 separate personas: users (customers) and advisors. When logging in to the website, the user entered password will be cross referenced with the password stored in the database and the username will be the user’s email address. When signing up, the email address will be validated. Every user’s password must be at least 8 characters long and must pass the password strength verification test. The shell of a payment management system was implemented. Advisors have their own login page separate from users.

Users are able to schedule appointments with advisors. Users are able to select a date and advisor when scheduling an appointment. After an appointment is scheduled, the appointment will appear in both the user and advisor's views. User's are not able to schedule overlapping appointments.

The financial tools page contains access to different financial calculators for loan interest, mortgage, budgeting, and retirement planning insurance coverage. Users are able to enter the relevant requested information in each calculator and it will return the calculated value. Customers will also have access to a monthly budget planner tool. This tool stores the income, expenses, savings, total budget, and total savings of each month as entered by the user. 

The learning hub allows access to blog posts written by advisors.

The event system contains a schedule of all events. Advisors can use the event system to create new events. An advisor may specify a maximum number of participants for a newly scheduled event. Users can use the event system to view all upcoming events in a calendar format and register to attend. After registering for an event, a confirmation email will be sent to the user containing the details of the event. Registration will not be allowed for past events or events that have reached the maximum number of registrants.

The news system contains the latest news articles on markets and finance and will be able to be viewed by all users and advisors. The system previews the headline of an article as well as the first few sentences, along with the date the article was posted. The news section also includes up to date information on the most followed stock indexes within the US: NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
